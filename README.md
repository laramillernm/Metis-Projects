### Natural Language Processing
Increasing public confidence in the integrity of New Mexico’s legislative process
•	Extracted legislative topics from 1500 pdfs of bills and lobbyist employers from 2013 to 2020 using NLP techniques including TF-IDF, LDA, and NMF. 
•	Created a tableau dashboard to highlight legislative topic areas with high lobbyist influence and to draw attention to the connection between lobbyist contributions, their employers, and legislators

### Classification
Predicting customer churn
•	Used supervised classification techniques to predict customer churn for Telco, a fictitious telecommunications company, and to identify areas within Telco business that could be improved to help retain customers.
•	Logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and naïve bayes classifiers were fitted and compared based on their F1 scores. The feature importance ranking of the highest performing model, random forest, was used directly to inform recommendation for retaining customers.

### Business Analysis
